# sampling

Open-source implementation of previously unimplemented foundational dynamic streaming algorithms, with a particular focus on semi-streaming graph algorithms.  Current early draft includes implementations of stream fingerprinting, $l_0$ sampling, $f_0$ sketching, and graph connectivity testing.

Will include implementations for graph problems including bipartiteness testing, cut sparsifiers, spectral sparsifiers, spanners, minimum spanning trees, maximum matchings, vertex connectivity, densest subgraph, and capacitated max cut.  Currently all implementations are in Python but will eventually be implemented in C++ as well.

For a primer on sketching and graph streaming algorithms, check out these excellent surveys by [Graham Cormode](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/~graham/pubs/papers/sk.pdf) and [Andrew McGregor](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mcgregor/papers/13-graphsurvey.pdf).
